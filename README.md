# Support Vector Classification (SVC) Implementation  

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Support Vector Classification (SVC)** using Python and Scikit-learn.  
It explores how SVMs can be used for supervised learning classification tasks, including model training, testing, and evaluation.

## 🚀 Features  
- Data preprocessing and splitting into train/test sets  
- Implementation of **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** using Scikit-learn  
- Model training on labeled data  
- Evaluation using metrics such as:  
  - Confusion Matrix  
  - Accuracy Score  
  - Classification Report  
- Visualization of decision boundaries (if applicable)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python 3.x**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **NumPy**  
- **Pandas**  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**  
- **Scikit-learn**

## ⚡ How to Run  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/svc-implementation.git
   cd svc-implementation
Install required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

📊 Results
The trained SVC model provides classification performance with metrics like accuracy and precision.

Example Confusion Matrix and Accuracy are included in the notebook.

🔮 Future Improvements
Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
Testing with different kernels (linear, polynomial, RBF, sigmoid)
Adding cross-validation for better performance estimation
Comparing SVC with other classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
